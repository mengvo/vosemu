# Vosume - Game Boy Emulator (Discontinued)

Vosume is a Game Boy emulator that I began as a way to learn systems-level programming, CPU architecture, and low-level memory management. While the project is no longer being developed, it provided me a great learning experience in how real hardware operates at the byte level.


## Features Implemented

- Memory layout
- Cartridge header loading
- Opcode and instruction map parsing
- Partial CPU emulation logic


## What I Learned

- How systems handle memory, registers, and flags
- Structuring large, low-level codebases in C
- Emulation basics
- CPU instruction decoding
- Binary manipulation and bitwise operations
- Makefile basics


## Final Notes

Although Vosume is no longer in active development, Iâ€™m proud of what I accomplished and how much I learned through this project. It was very interesting to learn how computers work at this lower level. I found it fascinating how clever people are to develop something as complex as a Game Boy.
